You must complete a series of tasks within the allocated time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and a set of tasks - you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

To score 100% you must complete all tasks within the time period!

When you take a Challenge Lab, you will not be taught Google Cloud concepts. To build the solution to the challenge presented, use skills learned from the labs in the course this challenge lab is part of. You will be expected to extend your learned skills; you will be expected to change broken queries.

This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the Derive Insights from BigQuery Data skill badge. Are you ready for the challenge?
